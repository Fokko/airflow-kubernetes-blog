    "[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source container deployment engine released by Google. Based on google's own [Borg](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2015/04/borg-predecessor-to-kubernetes.html), kubernetes allows for easy deployment of images using a highly flexible API. Using kubernetes you can [deploy spark jobs](https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark), launch end-to-end applications, or ... using yaml files, python, golang, or java bindings. The kubernetes API's programatic launching of containers seemed a perfect marriage with Airflow's \"code as configuration\" philosophy.\n",

    "As DevOps pioneers, we are always looking for ways to make our deployments and ETL pipelines simpler to manage. Any opportunity to reduce the number of moving parts in our codebase will always lead to future opportunities to break in the future. The following are a list of benefits the Kubernetes Operator in reducing the Airflow Engineer's footprint\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Increased flexibility for deployments** Airflow's plugin API has always offered a significant boon to engineers wishing to test new functionalities within their DAGS, however it has always had the downside that to create a new operator, one must develop an entirely new plugin. Now any task that can be run within a docker container is accessible through the same same operator with no extra airflow code to maintain.\n",
    "* **Flexibility of configurations and dependencies** For operators that are run within static airflow workers, dependency management can become quite difficult. If I want to run one task that requires scipy, and another that requires numpy, I have to either maintain both dependencies within my airflow worker, or somehow configure\n",
    "* **Usage of kubernetes secrets for added security** Handling sensitive data is a core responsibility of any devops engineer. At every opportunity, we want to minimize any API keys, database passwords,  or ... to a strict need-to-know basis. With the kubernetes operator, we can use the kubernetes Vault technology to store all sensitive data. This means that the airflow workers will never have access to this information, and can simply request that pods be built with only the secrets they need"
