    "[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source container deployment engine released by Google. Based on google's own [Borg](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2015/04/borg-predecessor-to-kubernetes.html), kubernetes allows for easy deployment of images using a highly flexible API. Using kubernetes you can [deploy spark jobs](https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark), launch end-to-end applications, or ... using yaml files, python, golang, or java bindings. The kubernetes API's programatic launching of containers seemed a perfect marriage with Airflow's \"code as configuration\" philosophy.\n",

The following are a list of benefits the Kubernetes Operator in reducing the Airflow Engineer's footprint\n",

    "* **Increased flexibility for deployments** Airflow's plugin API has always offered a significant boon to engineers wishing to test new functionalities within their DAGS, however it has always had the downside that to create a new operator, one must develop an entirely new plugin. Now any task that can be run within a docker container is accessible through the same same operator with no extra airflow code to maintain.\n",
    "* **Flexibility of configurations and dependencies** For operators that are run within static airflow workers, dependency management can become quite difficult. If I want to run one task that requires scipy, and another that requires numpy, I have to either maintain both dependencies within my airflow worker, or somehow configure"
